# Analog Unified LED Strip controller

This is a controller I designed to drive an RGBW 12V LED strip. Can drive up to 16A total (4A per color channel). 

This was designed with the RGBW 5050 LED Strip [here](https://ledlightsworld.com/products/dc-12v-rgbw-rgbww-high-density-30leds-9-6w-per-meter-4in1-smd5050-rgbw-led-flexible-strip-light) in mind. The intent was to surround the perimeter of my bedroom with these, which would have required around 3.5 rolls (17.5 meters). This would have required a lot of power (~160W) hence the large traces. However, pivoting to using addressable LEDs instead. But decided to keep this design for posterity's sake.
