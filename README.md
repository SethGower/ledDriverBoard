# LED Driver Board

This is a Circuit and PCB design for an LED Strip driver I designed for personal use. I designed this to be able to have an LED strip on the perimeter of my bedroom. Given the perimeter is about 55 feet, this would require a lot of power. The original strip I looked at required 24W/m at full brightness of all 4 color channels (RGBW), since this was 60 LED/m. Due to the power requirements of this, I reduced the strip I was using to a 30 LED/m, which required 9.6 W/m. I originally designed it to drive an LED strip that doesn't have individual addressable channels. I changed the design to be able to drive an individually addressable strip, in order to have more control over the lighting.

There are three designs in this repo. The original, located in `Non_Addressable` contains the original design, which used the non addressable LED strip. The intention with this design was to use [ESPHome](https://esphome.io). The different channels were to be driven with PWM to control brightness. The Second design, for the addressable LED strips is located in `Addressable_Driver`. This was intended to be used with [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge). The final design, located in `Unified` is a combination of the two designs, on the same PCB. So only one design needs to be manufactured, and the user can decide which portion to use. All of the designs use an ESP32-DO-IT board as the controller. Make sure it is the 30 pin version.
